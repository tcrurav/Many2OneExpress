## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/Many2OneExpress.git

```

1. You need a Bicycles/backend/db.config.js file with the data for the connection to your MySQL Server:

```
module.exports = {
  HOST: "localhost",
  USER: "root",
  PASSWORD: "your password",
  DB: "db_bicycles",
